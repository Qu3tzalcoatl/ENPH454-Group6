This is Jinho's image-identification code.

It should be able to take a wake-up signal from (Doug's) input-detection code and start.
It should be able to capture an image of the garbage in the bin and run a image recognition
software to identify the type of waste in the bin.

It should also send a signal to (Ryan's) stepper-control code based on the classification of
the waste.
